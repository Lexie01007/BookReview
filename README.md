# BookReview
Our overall objective was to analyse a collection of datasets containing detailed information about books and their reviews by users of an online bookstore and extract insights to help managers of the bookstore understand what factors may influence the readers' reviews. In our analysis, we examine the potential influence of three key factors on book ratings: the author of the book, the countries of the users, and the ages of the users. Initial findings suggest that the impact of these factors on book ratings is relatively minimal. This observation may be influenced by the distribution characteristics of our test dataset.
